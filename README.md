# A script to increase florinstagram dertermox

# 1. First of all, we do Termux

apt update

# 2. Then we install the Python package in Termux

apt install python

# 3. After Python is installed, if you haven't installed GitHub, we will install the Git package

apt install git

# After that, we run the link containing the cloned Instaboot in Termux

git clone https://github.com/instagramcode-py/instagramcode.git

# For initial execution:

chmod +x instabot_termux.py

# And to finish and enter the tool, we run the bottom code in Termux
